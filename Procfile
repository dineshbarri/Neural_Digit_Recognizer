web: gunicorn flask_app:app  


#Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) is a WSGI HTTP Server that: Handles multiple requests simultaneously using worker processes.

# Gunicorn bridges the gap between your Flask app and production environment, providing the performance, stability, and security needed for real-world usage.

#The Procfile simply tells your deployment platform(render.com): "Use Gunicorn to serve this Flask application in production mode."
